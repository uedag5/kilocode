# JetBrains Plugin Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues when using Kilo Code in JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, WebStorm, PyCharm, etc.).

## Known Missing Features

The following features, available in the VS Code version of Kilo Code, are not currently implemented in the JetBrains version:

- **Autocomplete/QuickTasks**
- **Git Commit Message Generation** This feature is missing but will be added soon!

We're actively working on bringing feature parity between the VS Code and JetBrains versions. Check our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode) for updates on development progress.

## JCEF (Java Chromium Embedded Framework) Issues

### What is JCEF?

JCEF (Java Chromium Embedded Framework) is required for Kilo Code's web-based interface to display properly in JetBrains IDEs. Most JetBrains IDEs include JCEF support by default, but some configurations may need manual activation.

## Fixing JCEF Issues by IDE

### Android Studio

JCEF is available in Android Studio but may need to be enabled manually:

1. **Open Settings/Preferences:**

    - **Windows/Linux:** File → Settings
    - **macOS:** Help → Find Action...

2. **Navigate to Boot Java Runtime:**

    - Choose Boot Java Runtime for the IDE...

3. **Pick a new runtime**

    - Pick one that has "with JCEF" in the name

4. **Restart Android Studio:**

    - Close and reopen Android Studio for the changes to take effect

5. **Verify:**
    - Open Kilo Code panel
    - The JCEF warning should be gone, and the interface should load properly

### IntelliJ IDEA

JCEF should be enabled by default in IntelliJ IDEA. If you see JCEF warnings:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA:**

    - Ensure you're running the latest version
    - Go to Help → Check for Updates

2. **Verify JetBrains Runtime:**

    - IntelliJ IDEA should use JetBrains Runtime (JBR) by default
    - JBR includes JCEF support

3. **Check Advanced Settings:**
    - Go to File → Settings (Windows/Linux) or IntelliJ IDEA → Preferences (macOS)
    - Navigate to Advanced Settings
    - Look for any JCEF-related options and ensure they're enabled

### Other JetBrains IDEs

For WebStorm, PyCharm, PhpStorm, RubyMine, CLion, GoLand, DataGrip, and Rider:

1. **Update to Latest Version:**

    - Most JCEF issues are resolved in recent versions
    - Use the built-in updater: Help → Check for Updates

2. **Verify JetBrains Runtime:**

    - These IDEs should use JetBrains Runtime by default
    - JBR includes comprehensive JCEF support

3. **Check Settings:**
    - Go to File → Settings (Windows/Linux) or [IDE Name] → Preferences (macOS)
    - Navigate to Advanced Settings
    - Enable any JCEF-related options
