# Migrating from Other Tools

Switch to Kilo for Teams from other AI coding tools and experience transparent pricing, no vendor lock-in, and superior team management capabilities.

## Why Teams Switch to Kilo

### Transparency vs. Opacity

**Other AI coding vendors** hide their true costs behind opaque subscription models, leaving you wondering what you're actually paying for.

**Kilo for Teams** shows you exactly what each AI request costs - no markup, no hidden fees, complete transparency.

### No Rate Limiting

**Other tools** slow you down with rate limits and model switching when you need AI most.

**Kilo for Teams** never limits your usage - pay for what you use, use what you need.

### True Team Management

**Other solutions** offer basic user management with limited visibility.

**Kilo for Teams** provides comprehensive team analytics, role-based permissions, and detailed usage insights.
