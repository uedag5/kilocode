<!-- ## Setting Usage Limits

### Daily Spending Limits

Control costs by setting daily limits per user:

1. **Go to Organization tab**
2. **Find team member** in the list
3. **Click "Set Limit"** next to their name
4. **Enter daily dollar amount** (e.g., $10.00)
5. **Save changes**

### How Limits Work

- **$0 = Unlimited** - No spending restrictions
- **Soft limits** - Users receive warnings at 80% of limit
- **Hard limits** - AI requests blocked when limit reached
- **Daily reset** - Limits reset at midnight UTC
- **Rollover** - Unused limits don't carry over to next day

### Recommended Limit Guidelines

**Individual Contributors**

- **Junior developers:** $5-10/day
- **Senior developers:** $10-20/day
- **Occasional users:** $2-5/day

**Team Leads and Architects**

- **Team leads:** $15-25/day
- **Architects:** $20-30/day
- **Heavy users:** $25-50/day

**Special Cases**

- **Demo/training days:** Temporarily increase limits
- **Hackathons:** Remove limits for event duration
- **New feature development:** Higher limits for exploration

### Monitoring Usage Patterns

Track team usage to optimize limits:

- **Weekly usage reports** show actual consumption
- **Peak usage days** help identify patterns
- **Model preferences** affect cost per request
- **Task complexity** influences daily needs -->

## Managing Team Composition

### Viewing Team Status

The Organization tab shows:

- **Active members** with last activity
- **Pending invitations** awaiting acceptance
- **Seat utilization** (used vs. available)
- **Role distribution** across the team

### Removing Team Members

When team members leave:

1. **Navigate to Organization tab**
2. **Find the departing member**

1. **Locate team member** in Organization tab
2. **Click role dropdown** next to their name
3. **Select new role** (Member, Admin, Owner)
4. **Confirm change**
5. **Member receives email notification**

### Cost Optimization Strategies

**Model Selection**

- Train team on cost-effective model choices
- Use cheaper models for simple tasks
- Reserve expensive models for complex problems
- Monitor model performance vs. cost

**Usage Patterns**

- Identify peak usage times
- Batch similar requests when possible
- Avoid redundant AI requests
- Share solutions across team members

**Limit Adjustments**

- Regularly review and adjust individual limits
- Increase limits for high-value activities
- Decrease limits for occasional users
- Set temporary limits for special projects
