# Starting Your First Task with Kilo Code

This quick tour shows how Kilo Code handles a simple request from start to finish.

After you [set up Kilo Code](/getting-started/setting-up), follow these steps:

## Step 1: Open the Kilo Code Panel

Click the Kilo Code icon (<img src="/docs/img/kilo-v1.svg" width="12" />) in the VS Code Primary Side Bar (vertical bar on the side of the window) to open the chat interface. If you don't see the icon, verify the extension is [installed](/getting-started/installing) and enabled.

*The Kilo Code icon in the Primary Side Bar opens the chat interface.*

## Step 2: Type Your Task

Type a clear, concise description of what you want Kilo Code to do in the chat box at the bottom of the panel. Examples of effective tasks:

* "Create a file named `hello.txt` containing 'Hello, world!'."
* "Write a Python function that adds two numbers."
* "Create an HTML file for a simple website with the title 'Kilo test'"

No special commands or syntax neededâ€”just use plain English.

*Enter your task in natural language - no special syntax required.*

## Step 3: Send Your Task

Press Enter or click the Send icon (<Codicon name="send" />) to the right of the input box.

## Step 4: Review and Approve Actions

Kilo Code analyzes your request and proposes specific actions. These may include:

* **Reading files:** Shows file contents it needs to access
* **Writing to files:** Displays a diff with proposed changes (added lines in green, removed in red)
* **Executing commands:** Shows the exact command to run in your terminal
* **Using the Browser:** Outlines browser actions (click, type, etc.)
* **Asking questions:** Requests clarification when needed to proceed

*Kilo Code shows exactly what action it wants to perform and waits for your approval.*

* In **Code** mode, writing capabilities are on by default.
* In **Architect** and **Ask** modes, Kilo Code won't write code.

The level of autonomy is configurable, allowing you to make the agent more or less autonomous. 

You can learn more about [using modes](/basic-usage/using-modes) and [auto-approving actions](/features/auto-approving-actions).

## Step 5: Iterate

Kilo Code works iteratively. After each action, it waits for your feedback before proposing the next step. Continue this review-approve cycle until your task is complete.

*After completing the task, Kilo Code shows the final result and awaits your next instruction.*

## Conclusion

You've completed your first task. Along the way you learned:

* How to interact with Kilo Code using natural language
* Why approval keeps you in control
* How iteration lets the AI refine its work
