# Using Kilo Code's Built-in Provider

Kilo Code provides its own built-in API provider that gives you access to the latest frontier coding models through a simple registration process. No need to manage API keys from multiple providers - just sign up and start coding.

**Website:** [https://kilocode.ai/](https://kilocode.ai/)

## Getting Started with Free Credits

When you sign up for Kilo Code, you may receive free credits to help you get started:

1. **Sign up:** Complete the registration (we might require a hold to verify identity)
2. **First top-up:**: Add funds to your account (min $5) and get $20 bonus credits
3. **Start Coding:** Enjoy your free credits

:::note About the temporary hold
The $0.50 hold is for identity verification only:

- **Not a charge** - This is a temporary authorization that will not be charged
- **Instant release** - Kilo Code releases the hold immediately after verification
- **Bank processing** - While we release instantly, it may take a few business days for funds to return (varies by bank)

## Registration Process

Kilo Code offers a streamlined registration that connects you directly to frontier coding models:

1. **Start Registration:** Click "Try Kilo Code for Free" in the extension
2. **Sign In:** Use your Google account to sign in at kilocode.ai
3. **Authorize VS Code:**
    - kilocode.ai will prompt you to open Visual Studio Code
